                    Howdy! My name is Harsh and I am a 23 year old Software Engineer with a passion for the poetry, travelling, and computer science. I have spent the last few years long-distance hiking and have accumulated more than 10,000 miles under my feet. During those times, I have developed a network of incredible friends around the world and narrowed down what I love about life. I spend a lot of my time coding, hiking, exercising, and playing billiards. I have always been interested in visualizing mathematical concepts and algorithms and am currently developing an API visualizer. Building new things is my way of expanding my knowledge and understanding of data.
