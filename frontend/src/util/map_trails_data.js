                        border of Mexico, and New Mexico, to Canada and Montana. Back in 2018 i started at Mexico, and walked it up to Canada. Over the 94 days it took me to walk it, I 
                        saw some of the most magical things i could imagine. I also met some very special people and built some amazing relationships. After being charged by a grizzly bear, woken up by a porcupine,
                        and dislocting my shoulder while traversing a steep snowfield, I can easily say this was the most fun of my life. To this day I look back at those fond memories and relive the special moments that it was.
                        With just a 8 pound backpack, I learned what ultralight truly is and really pushed my speed and limits on this trail. With hitting 50 miles days consistently towards the end. I will never be the same.`,

                        and Canada. In the Summer of 2017 I decided to start my first thru-hikr from Canada. It took me 105 days to complete the PCT, and was an absolute blast. That year was one of the biggest snow years, and the 
                        fields in Washington were incredibly steep and icy. It seemed as if I was always out running fires, and could never figure out how to avoid them but to walk faster.
                        Being my first thru-hike this trail taught me a lot about expectations, and discipline. The end was anti-climactic and didnt really bring much joy. It really was everything,
                        in between that was special.`,

            'details': `The CCT, or more popularly known as The California Coastal Trail is a 1200 mile trail that is not fully complete, and spans the length of the California Coast.
                        I actually did the CCT over the course of 2 years. I tend to hike this trail a lot and I never know why. I have come to really enjoy sections of it, but other sections can be really miserable
                        because of the amount of road walking there is. I have found myself absolutely in love with the redwoods, and that is why I always find myself going back to hike this trail.
                        Also what is special about this trail is the amount of night hiking that is perfect. Having the fog roll in with the ocean air, as I would hike highway 1 in Mendocino, and Sonoma through the whole night
                        with not a single car all night can be incredibly special.`,
